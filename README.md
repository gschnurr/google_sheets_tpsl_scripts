<b>Overview:</b>
<p>
This is a series of scripts made to be used with specifically formatted Google Sheets. The Google Sheets each act as a database
containing the information that is manipulated by the scripts. The 'database' information is used in form generation, sheet creation,
and google drive manipulation.

<b>Contents and Purpose:</b>

TBD
</p>
<b>How To:</b>
<p>
Copy and paste the code into your script editor in google sheets. Work with me to have the specific sheets created.
</br>
If you are just browsing the global variables have some decent functions to work with arrays and queries to your google sheets.
